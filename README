*** 0. INTRODUCTION ***
These procedures have been modified from the Erik's original code, in
an attempt to speed things up. To try this out, use the /FAST keyword
to topologize.pro. 

I've made two types of modifications, which I describe below. The
first set are changes to the IDL code, and work by default. The second
set involve IDL calling new procedures written in C. 

IMPORTANT: For some of these changes to work, you will have to compile
           the file libdendro.c, described in section 3 of this document.


*** 1. Changes to the IDL code *** 

1) decimate_kernels.pro
The way insiginificant leaves are pruned from the dendrogram has been
modified. In the original code, this happened during
decimate_kernels.pro. This function searched for the contour values
defining the first merger for each leaf. It then rejected leaves with
insufficient contrast above the merger, or with too small of an area.

The poor-contrast leaves can be excised much more efficiently than
this, by testing whether the contour level with the minimum acceptable
contrast encloses any other leaves. 

In practice, the minimum area criterion is usually redundant, since
small peaks tend to also fail the contrast test. At the moment, this
test is thus skipped, which saves some time. In the future, this test
should be added to cnb_mergefind (see documentation in that file).

cnb_decimate_kernels re-impements decimate_kernels, using the
fast-contrast test, and skipping the area test.

2) mergefind.pro

This routine is meant to identify the contour levels at which each
pair of kernels merge. It does so by generating a large number of
contours and searching for the important levels.

cnb_mergefind.pro re-implements this procedure as a binary
search. This method avoids creating unncecessary contour levels, and
also avoids having to define an intelligent "first guess" at which
contour levels to try. It's thus faster and more robust than mergefind.pro

*** 2. C-based changes ***

There are a few C-based functions in libdendro.c that are meant to
replace certain calls to label_seed, and all calls to
alllocmax.pro. The IDL functions label_region.pro and
cnb_alllocmax.pro are wrappers that call these C programs. For this to
work, you must compile libdendro.c and create the shared library libdendro.so.

If you don't know how to do this, the IDL function "make_dll" may help.

If IDL can't find libdendro.so at runtime, it will use the (slower) routines alllocmax and label_region.


*** 3. Hints on compiling libdendro.c ***

I ran the following commands on my (64 bit) linux machine, to get
libdendro.so to work with by (32 bit) IDL version:

gcc -Wall -I /usr/local/rsi/idl70/external/include -fPIC -L. -c -m32 -fno-stack-protector libdendro.c
ld -shared -soname libdendro.so.1 -o libdendro.so.1.0 -melf_i386 -lc libdendro.o
ldconfig -v -n .
ln -sf libdendro.so.1 libdendro.so

if both IDL and your OS are 32 or 64 bit, then you can dispense with the -m32 and -melf_i386 options

To compile on my mac, I used the IDL routine make_dll in the directory where libdendro.c was
IDL> make_dll, 'libdendro', 'libdendro', input_dir='.', output_dir='.'

(make sure libdendro.so ends up in a directory in your IDL path)


*** 4. Description of the structure created by TOPOLOGIZE ***
The TOPOLOGIZE function runs the dendrogram analysis on a data cube. It
produces a structure with the following tags:

 -- MERGER. An [n_leaf, n_leaf] matrix. Element [i,j] gives the intensity
    threshhold at which leaf i and j merge
 -- CLUSTER_LABEL. A vectorized (1D) labeling of structures in the data
    cube. Entry i provides the ID of the highest (i.e. closest to leaf)
    structure associated with a pixel in the data cube. The location of that
    pixel is given by x[i], y[i], and v[i]. (Though see warning for X)
 -- CLUSTER_LABEL_H. A histogram of CLUSTER_LABEL, starting at index 0
 -- CLUSTER_LABEL_RI. The reverse indices vector for CLUSTER_LABEL_H
 -- LEVELS. A vector of contour levels at which mergers were searched
    for. This is not used if TOPOLOGIZE is called with /FAST
 -- CLUSTERS. A [2, n_leaf - 1] array encoding all of the mergers in the
    dendrogram. clusters[*, i] gives the ID of the two structures that merge
    to form structure (i + n_leaf) (0-indexed)
 -- HEIGHT: A (2 * n_leaf - 1) array listing the height (i.e. intensity) of
    each structure. Along with XLOCATION, this array can be used to make
    plots. 
 -- KERNELS: A vector of (1D) indices, giving the location of the kernels
    (i.e. the local maxima which define each leaf)
 -- ORDER: ??? Created by DENDROGRAM_MOD. Permutes the order of the kernels,
    somehow. 
 -- NEWEMERGER: A permuted version of MERGER, which is ordered according to
    the ORDER tag.
 -- X: A vectorized (1D) list of x locations in the cube. Used with
    CLUSTER_LABEL. This vector trims away masked out regions to save
    space. CAUTION: this pixel index is offset from the original data cube by
    an unspecified amount. Use dendro_offset.pro to calculate the offset.
 -- Y: Like X, but for y locations
 -- V: Like X, but for V (i.e. Z in a PPV cube) locations.
 -- szdata: The output of size() called on the MINI cube
 -- cubeindex: The [x,y,z] arrays, converted into a 1D index
 -- ALL_NEIGHBORS: A 0/1, indicating if all_neighbors was set in calls to
    alllocmax, label_region, etc.
 -- err: The error cube, in a vectorized form
 -- xlocation: An arbitrarily sorted list of x coordinates for each dendrogram
    structure. Can be used with HEIGHT to make untangled dendrogram plots.
